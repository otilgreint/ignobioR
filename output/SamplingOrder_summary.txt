SAMPLING ORDER OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
=====================================

Number of plots: 50
Number of OGUs: 1
DEM data used: Yes
NDVI weight: 1
DEM weight: 0.5
Mean environmental distance: 0.379

FIELD-READY CSV CONTENTS:
------------------------
Plot_ID: Original plot identifier
Sampling_Order: Optimized sequence within each OGU (1 = sample first)
Latitude/Longitude: WGS84 coordinates for GPS
NDVI: Vegetation index value
Elevation_m: Elevation in meters

FIELD INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------
1. Open the field-ready CSV on your device
2. Sort by Sampling_Order column
3. Navigate to the Lat/Lon of the first plot
4. Sample that plot, then move to the next in order

This order maximizes environmental diversity capture.
If you run out of time/budget, you've still sampled across the full gradient.
