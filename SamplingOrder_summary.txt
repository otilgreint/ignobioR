SAMPLING ORDER OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
=====================================

Number of plots: 50
Number of clusters: 2
Clustering method: spatial
DEM data used: Yes
NDVI weight: 1
DEM weight: 0.5
Mean environmental distance: 0.379

CLUSTER INFORMATION:
-------------------
Cluster 1: 27 plots
Cluster 2: 23 plots

FIELD-READY CSV CONTENTS:
------------------------
Plot_ID: Original plot identifier
Sampling_Order: Optimized sequence (1 = sample first)
Cluster: Spatial group (choose which to sample first)
Latitude/Longitude: WGS84 coordinates for GPS
NDVI: Vegetation index value
Elevation_m: Elevation in meters

FIELD INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------
1. Open the field-ready CSV on your device
2. Choose which Cluster to sample first (based on accessibility)
3. Filter to that cluster and sort by Sampling_Order
4. Navigate to plots using Lat/Lon in order
5. When cluster complete, move to next cluster

Each cluster is ordered to maximize diversity within that spatial group.
